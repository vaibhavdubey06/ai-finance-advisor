# üöÄ Production Deployment Security Checklist

## **PRE-DEPLOYMENT SECURITY CHECKLIST**

### **üî¥ CRITICAL - COMPLETE BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**

#### **1. API Key Security**
- [ ] **ALL exposed API keys have been REVOKED**
- [ ] **NEW API keys generated with restrictions**
- [ ] **Production keys are different from development keys**
- [ ] **API keys are stored in secure environment variables (not in code)**
- [ ] **Git history cleaned of exposed keys**

#### **2. Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] **Firebase Authentication is properly configured**
- [ ] **Firebase service account key is secured**
- [ ] **Backend API requires authentication for sensitive endpoints**
- [ ] **Rate limiting is active (10 requests/minute)**
- [ ] **CORS is restricted to production domains only**

#### **3. Environment Configuration**
- [ ] **Production `.env` file is configured**
- [ ] **Debug logging is disabled in production**
- [ ] **Error messages don't expose sensitive data**
- [ ] **Security headers are enabled**

### **üü° HIGH PRIORITY**

#### **4. Data Protection**
- [ ] **Sensitive user data logging is removed**
- [ ] **User financial data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)**
- [ ] **Firebase security rules are properly configured**
- [ ] **Input validation is enabled**

#### **5. Infrastructure Security**
- [ ] **HTTPS is enforced (no HTTP)**
- [ ] **Server security headers are configured**
- [ ] **Database access is restricted**
- [ ] **Backup strategy is in place**

### **üü¢ RECOMMENDED**

#### **6. Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] **Security event monitoring is set up**
- [ ] **API usage monitoring is enabled**
- [ ] **Error tracking is configured**
- [ ] **Performance monitoring is active**

#### **7. Compliance & Documentation**
- [ ] **Privacy policy is updated**
- [ ] **Terms of service include data handling**
- [ ] **Security documentation is current**
- [ ] **Incident response plan is ready**

## **DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION UPDATES**

### **Frontend (React/Vite) Updates:**

#### **1. Update CORS Origins**
```javascript
// In server.js - Update with your production domain
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [
    'https://yourdomain.com',
    'https://www.yourdomain.com'
  ],
  credentials: true
};
```

#### **2. Update API Endpoints**
```javascript
// Update API base URLs for production
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? 'https://api.yourdomain.com' 
  : 'http://localhost:8080';
```

### **Backend (Python/FastAPI) Updates:**

#### **1. Update CORS Configuration**
```python
# In langgraph_backend/main.py
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://yourdomain.com",
        "https://www.yourdomain.com"
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST"],
    allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
)
```

#### **2. Production Environment Variables**
```bash
# Set these in your production environment
export ENVIRONMENT=production
export LOG_LEVEL=info
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-new-production-key
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=/path/to/production/key.json
```

## **SECURITY TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Before Going Live:**

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - [ ] Verify Firebase authentication works
   - [ ] Test rate limiting (should block after 10 requests/minute)
   - [ ] Confirm unauthorized requests are blocked

2. **API Security Testing**
   - [ ] Test with invalid/expired tokens
   - [ ] Verify CORS restrictions work
   - [ ] Check input validation (long strings, special characters)

3. **Data Protection Testing**
   - [ ] Confirm sensitive data is not logged
   - [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced
   - [ ] Test error handling (no data leakage)

4. **Infrastructure Testing**
   - [ ] SSL certificate is valid
   - [ ] Security headers are present
   - [ ] Database connections are secure

## **POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING**

### **Week 1 - Immediate Monitoring:**
- [ ] Monitor API error rates
- [ ] Check for authentication failures
- [ ] Review security logs daily
- [ ] Monitor unusual traffic patterns

### **Month 1 - Ongoing Security:**
- [ ] Review API usage patterns
- [ ] Check for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Validate backup systems
- [ ] Security incident response test

### **Quarterly - Security Maintenance:**
- [ ] Rotate API keys
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing review

## **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **If Security Breach Detected:**

1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
   - [ ] Revoke all API keys immediately
   - [ ] Disable affected user accounts
   - [ ] Take system offline if necessary

2. **Assessment (15-60 minutes)**
   - [ ] Identify scope of breach
   - [ ] Check for data exposure
   - [ ] Document incident timeline

3. **Recovery (1-24 hours)**
   - [ ] Generate new API keys
   - [ ] Reset affected passwords
   - [ ] Deploy security patches
   - [ ] Restore secure service

4. **Post-Incident (24-72 hours)**
   - [ ] Notify affected users
   - [ ] Update security measures
   - [ ] Document lessons learned
   - [ ] Review and improve procedures
